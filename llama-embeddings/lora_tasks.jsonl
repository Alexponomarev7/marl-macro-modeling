The first-order condition of the consumer problem is:\n\n\\int_0^N c_k^{\\alpha - 1} \\, dk = \\lambda p_k,\n\nwhere \\lambda is the multiplier on the budget constraint. Solving for c_k and substituting into the budget constraint to solve for \\lambda, we get the demand functions:\n\nc_k = \\frac{Y}{p_k^\\sigma \\bar{p}^{1-\\sigma}},\n\nwhere Y is income and \\bar{p} = \\left( \\int_0^N p_k^{1-\\sigma} \\, dk \\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\sigma}} is the consumption-based price index.\n\nTaking into account non-tradability, we get:\n\nc_k = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{Y_1}{p_k^\\sigma \\bar{p}_1^{1-\\sigma}}, & k \\in [0, P_1], \\\\\n\\frac{Y_1 + Y_2}{p_k^\\sigma \\bar{p}_1^{1-\\sigma} + \\bar{p}_2^{1-\\sigma}}, & k \\in [P_1, P_1 + N_1], \\\\\n\\frac{Y_2}{p_k^\\sigma \\bar{p}_2^{1-\\sigma}}, & k \\in [P_1 + N_1 + N_2, N].\n\\end{cases}\n\n2.
